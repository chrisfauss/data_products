## 3-D Investigation

Plot compares miles per gallon, weight and quarter mile time from the mtcars data set in 3D scatter plot.
```{r, echo = TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Data preparation
        library(plotly)
        d <- mtcars
        d <- d[,c(1,2,6,7)]
        names(d) <- c("miles_per_gallon","number_cylinders","weight","qrt_mile_time")

```


```{r cars, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(d, x = ~weight, y = ~miles_per_gallon, z = ~qrt_mile_time,
        type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = as.factor(d$number_cylinders))
```
